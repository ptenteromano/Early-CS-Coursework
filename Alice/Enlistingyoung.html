<br>
<br>
As a four year army veteran, I am incredibily glad I enlisted. My one
regret is not doing it sooner. I joined when I was 22 years old, after
I withdrew from college and didn't really have a direction in life.
There was a fire inside of me that drove me towards the military,
motivated me to succeed and carry on as a working member of society.
And four years later, I stand here as proof of just that.<br>
<br>
It's my personal opinion that for most people, 17 and 18 years old is
too young to be thrown into the world of college and adult
responsibilties. I believe if young adults served a mandatory year or
two to our country, whether it be the military or a civil one, the
United States as a whole would benefit greatly. A stronger working
class, more educated individuals, a greater sense of pride, and,
indirectly, a stronger defense. The millions of dollars we throw away
could be put towards the salary and benefits of the service men and
women who come out at the age of 20, mature and aware of the world we
live in.<br>
<br>Ultimately, it's up to the individual what they want to do in life. But this is just my opinion, and my own experience.<br>
